Hello, myself Satyam Sharma. I am in Unit-1 in masai. Masai is a institute that focus not only on students skills but also their personality improvement too.
I have joined masai on 19th of december,2022. I had learned many things from masai and process of learning is not stopped here it will be going on till I will not chase my dream. I am following masai 11-11-6 journey , in the beginning it seems difficult but now i am comfortable with this schedule and enjoying the learning from masai. Learning from boring mood will not make anyone skillful and i am very comfortable with masai as it keeps me motivated.
